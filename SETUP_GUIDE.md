# Trust Escrow Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

I've identified and fixed several issues in your Trust Escrow project:

1. **Wallet Connection Logic**: Fixed the misplaced `resetConnectionState()` call that was clearing the connection immediately after establishment
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in the Web3Context with more specific error messages
3. **Network Configuration**: Configured for Polygon mainnet
4. **Data Fetching**: Fixed issues with missing timestamps and improved escrow data handling
5. **Notifications**: Created better notification system to replace problematic alerts

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key_here
```

### 2. Get MATIC

For Polygon mainnet, you'll need real MATIC:
- Purchase MATIC from exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc.
- Transfer to your wallet address

### 3. Deploy Contract to Polygon Mainnet

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Deploy to Polygon mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
```

### 4. Update Contract Address

After deployment, copy the new contract address and update `src/contracts/Escrow-address.json`:

```json
{
  "address": "YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE"
}
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

## What Was Fixed

### Web3Context.js
- ✅ Fixed connection logic that was resetting state immediately
- ✅ Improved error handling with specific messages
- ✅ Configured for Polygon mainnet (chainId: 0x89)
- ✅ Better handling of empty escrow lists
- ✅ Improved account change handling

### Dashboard.js
- ✅ Fixed missing timestamp handling
- ✅ Improved error states
- ✅ Better data validation

### Hardhat Config
- ✅ Configured for Polygon mainnet
- ✅ Better network configuration
- ✅ Added etherscan verification support

## Testing the Fix

1. **Connect Wallet**: The wallet should now connect properly to Polygon mainnet
2. **No More Error Notifications**: The problematic notifications should be replaced with better toast messages
3. **Data Loading**: Even with no transactions, the app should work without errors
4. **Create Escrow**: You should be able to create new escrows

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Check Network**: Make sure MetaMask is connected to Polygon mainnet
2. **Check Contract**: Verify the contract is deployed and the address is correct
3. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools to see detailed error messages
4. **MATIC Balance**: Ensure you have MATIC for transactions

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the contract to Polygon mainnet
2. Update the contract address
3. Test the wallet connection
4. Create your first escrow transaction

The application should now work smoothly without the connection and data fetching issues you were experiencing!
